1. Shadow Dom (Css View Encapsulation)
    1.1 Emulated (Default)
    1.2 None
    1.3 Shadow Dom
    1.4 Native (Deprecated as of 6.1, instead of use Shadow Dom) 

1.1 Emulated
    Emulated is the default view encapsulation by angular, they do it by adding attributes
    to the components

1.3 Shadow Dom
    Shadow Dom won't obey the outside css/scss/sass, it's only considers the components css

1.2 None
    When we use None, the scope of the component css will become global rather than private
